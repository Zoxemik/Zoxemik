## 🎮 **My Game Dev Journey**

### 🧒 **Early Days (Scratch → Unreal)**
- Built a **Pac-Man clone in Scratch** (elementary school project).  
- Jumped into **Unreal Engine 4.22** at age ~14 (made a simple shooter with AI/particles).  
- **"It was too hard back then… but I still have the project!"**  

### ⚔️ **Unity Era (Team Competition)**
- Served as **lead programmer** in a national game dev tournament.  
- Developed a **2D roguelike** – lost in quarter-finals *(but learned a ton)*.  

### 📚 **Education Break**
- Earned my **IT Technician diploma** (focused on programming, networks, databases).  

### 🔥 **Current Unreal Engine Obsession** (One year)  
- Completed **Stephen Ulibarri’s Unreal C++ course** (RIP deleted project 😅).  
- Built a **Custom C++ Movement System** (Lyra-inspired, animation-heavy).
- Crafting a **2D endless runner** (*Donkey Kong Country* vibes).
